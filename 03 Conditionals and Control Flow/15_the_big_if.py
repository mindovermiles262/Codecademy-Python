Write an if statement in the_flying_circus(). It must include:

if, elif, and else statements;
At least one of and, or, or not;
A comparator (==, !=, <, <=, >, or >=);
Finally, the_flying_circus() must return True when evaluated.
Don't forget to include a : after your if statements!

# Make sure that the_flying_circus() returns True
def the_flying_circus():
    if 3 == 3 and 4 == 4:    # Start coding here!
        return True # Don't forget to indent
        # the code inside this block!
    elif 3 > 4 or 4 * 3 >= 13:
        return False # Keep going here.
        # You'll want to add the else statement, too!
