For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to 
that value.

Remember, comparators are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <=.

Use at least three different ones!

Don't just use True and False! That's cheating!

# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5  # We already did this one for you!

# Make me false!
bool_two = 3 > 5

# Make me true!
bool_three = 3 < 5

# Make me false!
bool_four = 3 == 5

# Make me true!
bool_five = 3 != 5
