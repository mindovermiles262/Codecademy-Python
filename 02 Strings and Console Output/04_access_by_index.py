On line 13, assign the variable fifth_letter equal to the fifth letter of the 
string "MONTY".

Remember that the fifth letter is not at index 5. Start counting your indices 
from zero.

"""

"""
The string "PYTHON" has six characters,
numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | Y | T | H | O | N |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type
"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)

fifth_letter = "MONTY"[4]
