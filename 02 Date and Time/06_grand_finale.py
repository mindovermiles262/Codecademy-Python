Print the date and time together in the form: mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.

To start, change the format string to the left of the % operator.

Ensure that it has 6 %s placeholders.
Put slashes and colons and a space between the placeholders so that they fit 
the format above.

Then, change the variables in the parentheses to the right of the % operator.

Place the variables so that now.month, now.day, now.year are before now.hour, 
now.minute, now.second. Make sure that there is a ( before the six and a ) 
after them.

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()

print('%s/%s/%s %s:%s:%s' % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second))
